"""RasMapper integration for exporting hydraulic result rasters.

Provides :class:`VrtMap` — a handle to a VRT raster exported by the map-store
executable — and :class:`MapperExtension`, a mixin that adds ``store_map`` /
``open_map`` and per-variable convenience wrappers (``export_wse``,
``open_wse``, etc.) to the Model class.

All map exports are performed by ``RasMapperStoreMap.exe``, a thin .NET stub
shipped with ``rivia`` in ``src/rivia/bin/``.  The stub exists because
``RasProcess.exe -Command=StoreAllMaps`` (the built-in HEC-RAS tool) has a
hard-coded defect: it always calls ``SharedData.SetSlopingRenderingMode()``
(JustFacepoints) before invoking the map engine, irrespective of the
``<RenderMode>`` element in the ``.rasmap`` file.  This means ``RasProcess.exe``
cannot produce ``horizontal`` or ``slopingPretty`` (hybrid) rasters — the
render-mode setting is silently ignored.  ``RasMapperStoreMap.exe`` fixes this
by reading the requested mode and calling the correct ``SharedData`` initialiser
before executing the same underlying ``StoreAllMapsCommand``, producing output
that is pixel-perfect against RasMapper's interactive export for all three modes.
It also supports ``tight_extent=True`` (default), which clips output tiles to
the model geometry footprint (2D flow areas + cross sections + storage areas),
matching RasMapper's "Original Extent" behaviour.

Output goes to ``{project_dir}/{plan_short_id}/`` by default; supply
``output_path`` to direct output to a different directory.

    ``Popen.kill()`` signals only the direct child.  A grandchild that inherited
    the stdout/stderr write handles keeps the pipe open after its parent dies,
    so the reader threads never see EOF.  On Windows ``taskkill /T`` is what
    reaches the descendants.

    **Order matters.**  ``taskkill /T`` discovers the tree by walking parent PIDs
    outward from the process named by ``/PID``, so that process must still be
    running when it is invoked; against an already-exited PID taskkill reports
    "process not found" and touches nothing.  ``Popen.kill()``
    (``TerminateProcess``) is also asynchronous, so calling it first would race
    taskkill's discovery pass.  taskkill goes first; ``kill()`` is the fallback.

    Consequently this is a **no-op once the root has exited** -- it early-returns.
    Descendants of a naturally-exited root cannot be reclaimed this way; see the
    ``stuck`` branch in :func:`_run_subprocess` for what happens instead.

    **Never raises.**  This is called directly from the ``TimeoutExpired``
    handler, i.e. while that exception is in flight, so anything escaping here
    would replace it with a cleanup artefact.  ``poll()``, ``wait()``,
    ``kill()`` and the ``logger`` calls can all raise in principle, so the
    guarantee is made by the blanket handler rather than by the inner
    suppressions, which only cover the *expected* failures.

        variable:

            ``"wse"`` / ``"water_surface"``, ``"depth"``, ``"velocity"``,
            ``"froude"``, ``"shear_stress"``, ``"dv"`` / ``"depth_x_velocity"``,
            ``"dv2"`` / ``"depth_x_velocity_sq"``.
        timestep:
            Zero-based index into the plan's output time series.  ``None``
            exports the maximum-value profile across all timesteps.
        raster_name:
            Stem of the output VRT file (no path separators, no extension).
            Defaults to ``"{display_name} ({profile_name})"``.
        output_path:
            Directory to write the VRT into.  Must already exist.  When
            ``None``, uses the **StoreAllMaps** strategy and output goes to
            ``{project_dir}/{plan_short_id}/``; when provided, uses the
            **StoreMap XML** strategy and output goes directly into that
            directory.
        render_mode:
            Water-surface interpolation mode passed to ``RasMapperStoreMap.exe``.
            Accepted values: ``"sloping"``, ``"hybrid"``, or
            ``"horizontal"`` (default).  The mode that matches RasMapper's interactive
            export depends on the ``<RenderMode>`` configured in the project's
            ``.rasmap`` file.
        use_depth_weights:
            When ``True``, face weights in the ``hybrid`` stencil are
            proportional to the face's water depth (``UseDepthWeightedFaces``).
            Only meaningful with ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        shallow_to_flat:
            When ``True`` (default), shallow cells are rendered flat
            (``ReduceShallowToHorizontal``).  Only meaningful with
            ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        tight_extent:
            When ``True`` (default), the output raster extent is clipped to
            the model geometry (2D flow area + cross sections + storage areas),
            pixel-aligned to the terrain grid — matching RasMapper's "Original
            Extent" behaviour.  When ``False``, output tiles cover the full
            terrain tile extent; cells outside the model are NoData.
        stream_output:
            When ``True`` (default) subprocess stdout/stderr are logged
            line-by-line in real time.  When ``False`` output is captured
            silently and only shown on error.
        timeout:
            Subprocess timeout in seconds.  ``None`` (default) means no limit.

        -------
        VrtMap

        Parameters
        ----------
        timestep:

        output_vrt:
            Destination for the exported VRT.  Three forms accepted:
            ``None`` — written to ``{project_dir}/{plan_short_id}/`` via the
            StoreAllMaps strategy; an existing directory — written into that
            folder with an auto-generated name; a path ending with ``.vrt`` —
            written to that exact file.
        render_mode:
            Water-surface interpolation mode passed to :meth:`store_map`.
            ``"horizontal"`` (default) renders a flat per-cell water surface.
            ``"sloping"`` uses cell-corner facepoints only.  ``"hybrid"`` adds
            face centroids with optional depth-weighted interpolation.  The
            mode that matches RasMapper's output depends on the project's
            ``.rasmap`` setting.
        use_depth_weights:
            When ``True``, face weights are depth-proportional.  Only
            meaningful with ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        shallow_to_flat:
            When ``True``, shallow cells are rendered flat.  Defaults to
            ``False``.  Only meaningful with ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        tight_extent:
            Passed through to :meth:`store_map`.
        stream_output:
            Stream subprocess output to the logger in real time.
        timeout:
            Subprocess timeout in seconds.  ``None`` means no limit.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError

        ----------
        timestep:

            folder with an auto-generated name; a path ending with ``.vrt`` —
            written to that exact file.
        render_mode:
            Water-surface interpolation mode passed to :meth:`store_map`.
            ``"horizontal"`` (default) renders a flat per-cell water surface.
            ``"sloping"`` uses cell-corner facepoints only.  ``"hybrid"`` adds
            face centroids with optional depth-weighted interpolation.  The
            mode that matches RasMapper's output depends on the project's
            ``.rasmap`` setting.
        use_depth_weights:
            When ``True``, face weights are depth-proportional.  Only
            meaningful with ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        shallow_to_flat:
            When ``True``, shallow cells are rendered flat.  Defaults to
            ``False``.  Only meaningful with ``render_mode="hybrid"``.
        tight_extent:

        stream_output:
            Stream subprocess output to the logger in real time.
        timeout:
            Subprocess timeout in seconds.  ``None`` means no limit.

        automatically re-exported when the terrain HDF is newer than the cached
        VRT (e.g. after adding or editing modifications in RASMapper).  Delete
        ``.rivia/`` to force a full refresh (e.g. after editing source TIFF
        pixel data in place, which does not update the terrain HDF mtime).

        The 2-D flow area is determined automatically: the method iterates
        the plan's flow areas and uses the first one whose mesh contains the
        line.  The line is assumed to lie entirely within one flow area.

        Parameters
        ----------
        xy : ndarray, shape (n_pts, 2), or object with ``__geo_interface__``
            Profile polyline vertices ``(x, y)`` drawn from left bank to
            right bank.  Accepts either an array-like of shape ``(n_pts, 2)``
            or any object that exposes a ``__geo_interface__`` mapping for a
            ``LineString`` geometry (e.g. a :class:`shapely.geometry.LineString`).
            Z coordinates are dropped.
        timestep : int or "max", optional
            Accepted for API symmetry with :meth:`wse_along_line` but not
            used: the underlying method always returns the full time-series.

        Returns
        -------
        pd.Series
            Index: simulation timestamps (datetime).  Values: signed
            volumetric discharge (model units^3/s) across the profile fence
            at each timestep.  Name is ``"discharge"``.  Positive flow is
            from left bank to right bank (when facing from *xy* start to
            *xy* end).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the line does not intersect any 2-D flow area in this plan.
